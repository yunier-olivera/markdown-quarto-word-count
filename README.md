# word-count

A VS Code extension that counts the number of words in a Markdown or Quarto document

This extension uses code from the `wordcountaddin` repository (https://github.com/benmarwick/wordcountaddin.git), an RStudio add-in for word counting. I'd like to thank the authors of this repository for their work.
