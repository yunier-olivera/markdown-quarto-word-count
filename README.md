# Markdown & Quarto Word Count

VS Code extension that counts the number of words in a Markdown or Quarto document.

The extension performs various text filtering to exclude certain elements such as code chunks, inline R code, HTML comments, and LaTeX figures and tables.

The extension counts the remaining words and displays the count as an information message. It also automatically counts the number of words in any selected text.

Some planned features for the extension include making it appear in the lower bar, adding shortcuts, and adding screenshots.

This extension uses code from the `wordcountaddin` repository (https://github.com/benmarwick/wordcountaddin.git), an RStudio add-in for word counting. I'd like to thank the authors of this repository for their work.
